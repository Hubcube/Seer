0.7.2:   
	0, new formats support by new plugins, .eps format, .docx format(faster than the old one, no need MSOffice)
	1, fix plugin bug -- if your plugins didn't work, remove them, download new, then add again
	2, fix shortcut bug, fix markdown file crash bug, fix bugs I can't recall
	3, ATTENTION!!! here is the important part: 
		When will Seer connect to internet quietly?
			1, check for application updates when Seer started;
			2, triggered a markdown file and this file contains a image with internet url;
			3, check for new plugins.
		You don't want Seer connect to internet at all?
			1, turn off "Auto check for updates" in "Settings - General";
			2, delete files named "ssleay32.dll" and "libeay32.dll" in installation folder.
		
		PLEASE...Please...please...just...stop...saying...Seer...is...a...spyware. _(:з」∠)_
