Hi everybody,
please let me know if you see anything incorrect.

Many of you may ask why Seer is only hosted on SF.net.
I didn't know much about SF.net when I first started using it, 
however, according to what I found on lifehacker.com, 
it says "the new owners removed all the spyware. It’s a whole lot better now". 
And what I know is everything has been well since the day I released the first version of Seer.

I thought about building a website for Seer, 
and it would enhance its creditability 
and reduce the amount of doubts and concerns 
about whether Seer is a safe and legitimate software. 
Also, no one would need to ask me for code, 
or to give poor rating on project page, 
or emailing me for installation files in China just because SF.net was banned.

The problem is that I don't have much resource and time to build this site. 
I am currently working full time, 
and I'm looking for a new job to improve my technology skills. 

Please reach out if you have any questions. 
Hope you find Seer to be a useful tool.

Thanks.
